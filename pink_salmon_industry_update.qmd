Over the last three years the UW-ASP group developed new methods based
on modern tools such as machine learning to increase our capability of
incorporating environmental data as well as the effects of other salmon
species and stocks that interact with Bristol Bay sockeye to improve
preseason forecast accuracy.Â  We are now applying these methods to
explore their potential for improving preseason forecasts of pink salmon
in Alaska, specifically in Southeast Alaska (SEA), Prince William Sound
(PWS), and Kodiak (KOD) regions.

We gathered data on historic pink salmon returns in even and odd years
across eleven sub-regions within the three main regions of SEA, PWS, and
KOD. We augmented these data with environmental data such as sea surface
